Any indexed bmp files in here can be used for the getRandomImage helper method in main.py.

Don't copy this readme to the pico it will try and load it at as image and crash when it randomly picks it.

If the files are not 128 x 160 in size the excess will be either cut off the screen or potentially left overs from
whatever the screen was showing before loading this image.
